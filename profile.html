                    <p>I am Lamberto B. Pabayo - III, I am 24 years old and I am a kind and simple student this is a short back story of my life. I started college year 2016 here in TCC studying
                        Batchelor of Science Major in Automotive Engineering. It's hard for me to learn everything about the course that i am taken, it felts like it's not my passion to fix and build 
                        machines. When I stepped in second yaer, due to financial problem and not willingly to continue the course I'm taken. I decided to stop my studies and work, but after years
                         college education became free and I decided to study again and choose the course I love. It is my second chance and Im on my 3rd year now. So blessed to attend free 
                        education in college. </p>
